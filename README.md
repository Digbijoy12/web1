To add your own info into the template just alter the [src/portfolio.js](src/portfolio.js) file variables. More customization options will come & be incorporated in the future üîÆ.

If you have any suggestions on what else you want to be customized through the [portfolio.js](src/portfolio.js) file or added / changed in general please feel free to reach out through the hosted page [contact form](https://forms.gle/vhWrKD32i1d2MSZGA) or leave an issue.

üôè I would greatly appreciate proper credit if you do decided to use this portfolio for any of your purposes. Just leaving the footer as is at the bottom of the template **Designed & Created by Maxim Shelepov** would be enough. Thanks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for your development, testing, & eventual deployment.

### Fork the repository (that's it really)
To keep your changes and version of the portfolio under your github and actions [fork this repository](https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio/fork). More on forking repositories [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

After creating your fork, you can make all content ([src/portfolio.js](src/portfolio.js)) updates and commits in github without cloning on your machine for local development. To run the deployment of your portfolio site make your first change to and commit (that will trigger the workflow and pages site deployment).

>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The following steps in this section describe the setup for local development which is recommended if you want to see your styling (css) and content (js and html) changes instantly without rebuilding the Github Actions site each time.
>

### For local development
You will need to install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), & [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

Using [brew](https://brew.sh) is recommended for mac users.

#### Clone the repository
Using the installed global packages from the previous step and your newly forked repository
```sh
# Copy this remote repository to your current directory (folder)
git clone https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio.git

# Change into the project folder within your current directory
cd webdev_portfolio
```

#### Install necessary project required packages
```sh
npm install
```

## How to Use
Once all is set up, you can start developing by running the vite server and viewing the site from your browser.
### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
```sh
npm run dev

# a localhost:####/webdev_portfolio link should appear -> paste into your browser and view
```

### Make commits and push them to your remote repository
Before adding and pushing to your remote repository you should [create it first in github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNMAE/webdev_portfolio.git # set a remote repo for git to point to
git remote -v # shows the set remote

git add . # add all the changes to the stage
git status # shows all the staged changes

git commit -m "Updating portfolio.js content."
git push
```
üéâ Now watch and enjoy as the latest commit appears in your remote repo and the automatic deployment begins. For deployment, check out the [Deployment](#deployment) section.

## Customizing Content

To personalize the template site to your content you can:
1. Populate your own information, appearance settings, & site behavioral setting in [src/portfolio.js](src/portfolio.js).
2. Change the [index.html](index.html) `<title></title>` tag to whatever text you want others to see in the browser tab (ex: name, title, etc.).
3. Add your own `favicon.ico` and `favicon.png` in the [public/](public) folder or **feel free to use the current emoji favicon** (the icon that will appear in the browser tab next to the title).
4. Optional: Use different global font for the site. You can choose one from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and then replace the import link in the [main.css](src/assets/main.css) file.

```javascript

const greeting = {
    intro: "...",
    message: "...",
    basedLocation: "...",
    resumeLink: "...",
    logoAbsoluteLink: "...",
    portraitAbsoluteLink: "..."
}

const about = { ... }

const experiences = { ... }

const works = { ... }

// ...

```

## Deployment

### To deploy on Github Pages
1. For fontawesome icons to work on the deployed site, visit *Settings -> Secrets and Variables -> Actions* and add your unique fontawesome registry auth token which can be found in your `~/.npmrc` or `webdev_portfolio/.npmrc` file ([more info about github action secrets here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)).
2. In the *Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow Permissions* set the github actions permission to **read & write**.
3. Make sure you set up git properly locally, created a remote repository, and are prepared to push to that remote. Take a look at [getting started section](#getting-started). For more information check out:
    - [Setting remote repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#remotes-and-forks).
    - [Pushing commits to remote](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push).

The github workflow [deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file should automatically start the build process for deployment to your github pages url: `https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/webdev_portfolio/` after you push to the main branch of your remote repository. Enjoy & Good Luck!

## Technologies Used
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev)
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Images and Icons
The images in the [src/assets/images/](https://github.com/feifyKike/webdev_portfolio/tree/main/src/assets/images) project folder are meant to serve as placeholders for your own images. Please intend to replace them with your own image assets.

The project comes pre-equipped with:
- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com) - Offer nice general-purpose icons. 2 icons used in the menu dropdown and 3 icons for project links.
    ```html
    <template>
        <Bars2Icon class="h-5 w-5 text-blue-500"/> <!-- insert into html like so as a tag -->
    </template>
    <script setup>
    import { Bars2Icon } from '@heroicons/vue/24/solid'
    <script>
    ```
- [fontawesome-icons](https://fontawesome.com) - Using the [font-awesome-brand-icons](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free&f=brands). 4 used for social media links.
    ```html
    <template>
        <font-awesome-icon icon="fa-brands fa-icon_name_here"></font-awesome-icon>
    </template>
    ```
    More instructions on adding these icons to your templates can be found here in the [icons.js](./src/icons.js) file.

üî≠ Take look at [heroicons basic usage](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons) & [adding icons with fontawesome tutorial](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/vue/add-icons) for more details.

‚ÑπÔ∏è All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. Do not use brand logos for any purpose except
to represent the company, product, or service to which they refer.

## Future
Hope to continue improving the site, as well as adding more components and layout options in the [src/components](src/components) folder.

**Planned Future Improvements:**
- [ ] Add more layout components to `src/components`.
- [ ] More color scheme styling options in `src/portfolio.js`.
